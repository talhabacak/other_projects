Constipation
reflects
pelvic
dysfunction
or
ttransit
time.
Accepted
definitions
and
reported
rates
vary,
but
a
place
to
start
is
the
passage
of
<2
bowel
motions/wk,
often
passed
with
difficulty,
straining,
or
pain,
and
a
sense
of
incomplete
evacua-
tion.
g:2:1.
Doctors’
chief
concerns
are
to
find
pointers
to
major
pathology,
eg
constipation+rectal
bleeding=cancer;
constipation
+
distension
+active
bowel
sounds~stricture/Gl
obstruction;
constipation
+
menorrhagia=hypothyroidism.

The
patient
Ask
about
frequency,
nature,
and
consistency
of
stools.
Is
there
blood
or
mucus
in/on
the
stools?
Is
there
diarrhoea
alternating
with
constipation
(eg
1Bs,
266)?
Has
there
been
recent
change
in
bowel
habit?
Is
she
digitating
the
rectum
or
vagina
to
pass
stool?”
Ask
about
diet
and
drugs.
»PR
examination
is
essential
even
when
referring
(refer
if
signs
of
colorectal
ca,
eg
weight,
pain,
or
anaemia).

Tests
None
in
young,
mildly
affected
patients.
Threshold
for
investigation
di-
minishes
with
age;
triggers
include:’
4weight,
abdominal
mass,
+PR
blood,
iron
deficiency
anaemia.
Blood:
FBC,
ESR,
U&E,
Ca,
TFT.
Colonoscopy:
If
suspected
colo-
rectal
malignancy.
Transit
studies;
anorectal
physiology;
biopsy
for
Hirschprung'’s
are
occasionally
needed.

Treatment
Often
reassurance,
drinking
more,
and
diet/exercise
advice
(1245)
is
all
that
is
needed.
Treat
causes
(Box
‘Causes
of
constipation’).
A
high-fibre
diet
is
often
advised,
but
may
cause
bloating
without
helping
constipation.
»Only
use
drugs
if
these
measures
fail,
and
try
to
use
them
for
short
periods
only.
Often,
a
stimulant
such
as
senna
+
a
bulking
agent
is
more
effective
and
cheaper
than
agents
such
as
lactulose.
Bulking
agents:
tFaecal
mass,
so
stimulating
peristal-
sis.
They
must
be
taken
with
plenty
of
fluid
and
may
take
a
few
days
to
act.
cI:
difficulty
in
swallowing;
cI
obstruction;
colonic
atony;
faecal
impaction.
Bran
powder
3.5g
2-3
times/d
with
food
(may
hinder
absorption
of
dietary
trace
ele-
ments
if
taken
with
every
meal).
Ispaghula
husk,
eg
1
Fybogel®
sachet
after
a
meal,
mixed
in
water
and
swallowed
promptly
(or
else
it
becomes
an
unpleasant
sludge).
Methylcellulose,
eg
Celevac®
3-6
tablets/12h
with
2300mL
water.
Ster-
culia,
eg
Normacol®
granules,
10mL
sprinkled
on
food
daily.
Stimulant
laxatives:
Increase
intestinal
motility,
so
do
not
use
in
intestinal
obstruction
or
acute
colitis.
Avoid
prolonged
use
as
it
may
cause
colonic
atony.
Abdominal
cramps
are
an
important
se.
Pure
stimulant
laxatives
are
bisacodyl
tablets
(5-10mg
at
night)
or
suppositories
(10mg
in
the
mornings)
and
senna
(2-4
tablets
at
night).
Docusate
sodium
and
dantron’
have
stimulant
and
softening
actions.
Glycerol
supposito-
ries
act
as
a
rectal
stimulant.
Sodium
picosulfate
(5-10mg
at
night)
is
a
potent
stimulant.
Stoo/
softeners:
Particularly
useful
when
managing
painful
anal
condi-
tions,
eg
fissure.
Arachis
oil
enemas
lubricate
and
soften
impacted
faeces.
Liquid
paraffin
should
not
be
used
for
a
prolonged
period
(Se:
anal
seepage,
lipoid
pneu-
monia,
malabsorption
of
fat-soluble
vitamins).
Osmotic
/axatives:
Retain
fluid
in
the
bowel.
Lactulose,
a
semisynthetic
disaccharide,
produces
osmotic
diarrhoea
of
low
faecal
pH
that
discourages
growth
of
ammonia-producing
organisms.
It
is
useful
in
hepatic
encephalopathy
(initial
dose:
30-50mL/12h).
se:
bloating,
so
its
role
in
treating
constipation
is
limited.
Macrogol
(eg
Movicol®)
is
another
ex-
ample.
Magnesium
salts
(eg
magnesium
hydroxide;
magnesium
sulfate)
are
use-
ful
when
rapid
bowel
evacuation
is
required.
Sodium
salts
(eg
Microlette®
and
Micralax®
enemas)
should
be
avoided
as
they
may
cause
sodium
and
water
re-
tention.
Phosphate
enemas
are
useful
for
rapid
bowel
evacuation
prior
to
proce-
dures.

If
these
don't
help
Prucalopride
is
an
elective
5HT4
agonist
with
prokinetic
prop-
erties;
Lubiprostone
is
a
chloride-channel
activator
that
increases
intestinal
fluid
secretion;
Linaclotide
is
a
guanylate
cyclase-c
agonist
that
also
increases
fluid
se-
cretion
and
decreases
visceral
pain.
A
multidisciplinary
approach
with
behaviour
therapy,
habit
training
+
sphincter
biofeedback
may
help.

Rectocele:

of

bulges
into
the
back
wall
of
the
vagina.
