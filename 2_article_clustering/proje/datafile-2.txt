cleansing—in
the
Balkans
in
the
1990s,
in
Rwanda
in
1994—were
carried
out
to
make
a
state
homogeneous,
composed
of
a
single
people.
Such
ruthless
drives
for
national
purity
run
up
against
the
intermixing
and
mobility
that
are
intrinsic
to
human
behavior.
Over
the
sweep
of
history,
the
heterogeneity
of
imperial
polities
comes
closer
to
reality
than
the
projected
sameness
of
the
nation-state.

Making
a
polity
homogeneous
requires
focusing
diverse
people’s
imaginations
and
practices
on
commonality
and
equivalence—producing
the
“horizontal”
community
that
Benedict
Anderson
described
in
1983.2
Some
of
the
national
polities
of
twentieth-century
Europe
were
the
product
of
a
deliberate
“unmixing
of
people,’
in
the
phrase
of
British
statesman
Lord
Curzon:
expulsions,
purges,
and
exterminations
on
the
territories
of
the
Habsburg
Empire
after
World
War
I,
new
waves
of
ethnic
cleansing
after
World
War
II,
and
again
in
the
Balkans
in
the
1990s.3
But
neither
ethnic
cleansing
nor
common
participation
in
state
institutions—“civic
nationalism,’
as
some
term
it—has
consistently
made
state
conform
to
nation.

Imagining
the
state
in
national
terms
was
and
remains
one
kind
of
political
vi-
sion,
among
other
more
complex
and
inclusive
ones.
Empire
is
not
the
only
form
of
political
organization
that
recognizes
and
reproduces
difference.
Federation
and
confederation,
in
theory
and
at
times
in
practice,
recognize
and
share
power
out
among
different
collectivities
within
an
overarching
political
structure.*
Confederations
may
give
rise
to
empires—the
Mongol
empires
sprang
from
Eurasian
tribal
confederations
and
alliances.
Or
empires
may
induce
the
formation
of
confederations,
whose
components
share
a
history
of
life
under
imperial
rule.

The
power
of
empires
to
set
the
context
for
both
imagination
and
possibility
is
evident
precisely
where
the
nation-state
was
supposed
to
have
been
the
model:
in
nineteenth-
and
twentieth-century
Europe
and
its
interactions
with
the
rest
of
the
world.
Inside
Europe,
people
with
national
or
supra-national
goals
(such
as
pan-
Slavism)
imagined
various
kinds
of
political
associations,
but
had
to
confront
the
power
of
the
dominant
empires—polities
that
did
not
limit
their
resources
to
one
category
of
population
or
one
space.>
Looking
beyond
Europe,
Wang
Hui
argues
that
the
“binary”
of
empire
and
nation-state
itself
emerged
as
European
elites
tried
to
write
themselves
into
a
“universal
world
history,’
in
which
the
nexus
of
Asia-
empire-despotism-backwardness
would
give
way
to
progress
configured
by
ec-
onomic
and
political
structures
of
European
design.
The
imposition
of
colonial
domination
on
much
of
the
world
compelled
other
powers
to
confront
this
form
of
imperial
power.
Consequently,
both
colonial
empire
and
resistance
to
it
provided
a
Eurocentric
story
of
outmoded
empires
giving
way
inevitably
to
nation-states
with
a
strong
hold
on
politics
and
scholarship.®
