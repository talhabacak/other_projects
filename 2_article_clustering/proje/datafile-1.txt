superiority
and
entitlements,
want
to
exploit
without
constraint
a
portion
of
the
incorporated
population;
others
see
a
longer
and
more
stable
future
in
combining
coercion
with
co-optation
and
giving
at
least
the
elites
of
subordinated
societies
something
to
gain
from
accommodation
to
imperial
rule.
Leaders
of
subordi-
nated
collectivities
have
at
times
sought
to
turn
rulers’
incorporative
claims
into
demands
for
a
fuller
role
in
the
empire’s
political
and
economic
life.
Distinction,
even
racialized,
can
become
a
claim
for
a
place—and
at
times
for
rights—in
empires
where
difference
is
a
recognized
and
ordinary
condition
of
social
life.

Because
empires
reproduce
distinction,
they
put
or
leave
in
place
collectivities
that
could
secede
from
or
take
over
the
imperial
polity.
Both
those
who
support
control
and
co-optation
and
those
who
seek
to
overthrow
an
imperial
regime
can
draw
on
and
amplify
people’s
sense
of
communal
privilege
or
their
resentment
of
the
alleged
advantages
enjoyed
by
others.
Empires’
tendency
to
expand,
split,
and
recombine
has
produced
not
only
armed
conflict,
but
also
struggles
to
redefine
or
alter
the
categories
of
difference.
Categories
of
distinction
are
not
mere
tools
of
the
historian;
they
can
be-
come
the
foundation
for
claims
and
counterclaims,
with
the
livelihood
and
dignity
of
many
people
at
stake.

Two
Influential
Variants
on
the
Politics
of
Difference

We
use
the
concept
of
the
politics
of
difference
more
broadly
and
more
neutrally
than
multiculturalists
who
agitate
for
recognition
of
distinct
communities
and
their
presumed
values.
This
contemporary
demand
derives
from
material
and
ideological
conditions
that
drew
different
peoples
together
in
the
first
place.
But
a
claim
based
on
cultural
authenticity
is
only
one
way
to
make
difference
an
element
of
politics.
The
politics
of
difference
in
some
empires
meant
recognizing
the
multiplicity
of
peoples
and
their
varied
customs
as
an
ordinary
fact
of
life;
in
others
it
meant
drawing
a
strict
boundary
between
insiders
and
“barbarian”
outsiders.
Let’s
consider
two
influential
empires
with
different
approaches
to
difference.

Rome:
The
Politics
of
Citizenship

During
its
long
existence,
the
Roman
Empire
tended
toward
homogenization,
based
on
a
distinctive
culture
that
developed
as
Rome
expanded.
The
idea
that
ul-
timate
power
rested
with
the
people
of
Rome
and
that
the
capacity
to
make
and
change
laws
devolved
from
the
citizenry
dated
to
the
early
Republic.
In
a
political
innovation
with
enormous
implications
for
future
politics,
Rome
gradually
ex-
tended
its
citizenship
beyond
the
limits
of
the
city
of
Rome,
first
to
nearby
and
de-
manding
peoples,
but
ultimately
(in

to
all
free
adult
males
in
the
empire.
This
inclusionary
strategy
defined
at
least
potentially
a
vast
number
of
people
