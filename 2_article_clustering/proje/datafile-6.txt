Haematemesis
is
vomiting
of
blood.
It
may
be
bright
red
or
look
like
coffee
grounds.
Melaena
(Greek
melas
=
black)
means
black
motions,
often
like
tar,
and
has
a
char-
acteristic
smell
of
altered
blood.
Both
indicate
upper
Gi
bleeding.

Summary:'
start
by
protecting
the
airway
and
giving
high-flow
0,,
then:

»»
Insert
2
large-bore
(14-16c)
Iv
cannulae
and
take
blood
for
Fc
(early
Hb
may
be
normal
because
haemodilution
has
not
yet
taken
place),
U&e
(turea
out
of
propor-
tion
to
creatinine
indicative
of
massive
blood
meal),
LFT,
clotting,
and
crossmatch.

>>
Give
IV
fluids
(p821)
to
restore
intravascular
volume
while
waiting
for
cross-
matched
blood.
If
haemodynamically
deteriorating
despite
fluid
resuscitation,
give
group
O
Rh-ve
blood.
Avoid
saline
if
cirrhotic/varices.

»»
Insert
a
urinary
catheter
and
monitor
hourly
urine
output.

>»
Organize
a
CxR,
ECG,
and
check
ABG.

>»
Consider
a
cvp
line
to
monitor
and
guide
fluid
replacement.

»»
Transfuse
(with
crossmatched
blood
if
needed)
if
significant
Hb
drop
(<70g/L).

»»
Correct
clotting
abnormalities
(vitamin
k
(p274),
FFP,
platelets).

>»
If
suspicion
of
varices
then
give
terlipressin
Iv
eg
1-2mg/6h
for
<3d;
relative
risk
of
death
|
by
34%.
Initiate
broad-spectrum
Iv
antibiotic
cover.

>»
Monitor
pulse,
BP,
and
cv
(keep
>5cmH20)
at
least
hourly
until
stable.

>»
Arrange
an
urgent
endoscopy
(p248).

»»
If
endoscopic
control
fails,
surgery
or
emergency
mesenteric
angiography/
embolization
may
be
needed.
For
uncontrolled
oesophageal
variceal
bleeding,
a
Sengstaken-Blakemore
tube
may
compress
the
varices,
but
should
only
be
placed
by
someone
with
experience.

Further
management
»Anatomy
is
important
in
assessing
risk
of
rebleeding.

Posterior
Dus
are
highest
risk
as
they
are
nearest
to
the
gastroduodenal
artery.


Re-examine
after
4h
and
consider
the
need
for
FFP
if
>4
units
transfused.

Hourly
pulse,
BP,
Cve,
urine
output
(4hrly
if
haemodynamically
stable
may
be
ok).

¢
Transfuse
to
keep
Hb
>70g/L;
ensure
a
current
valid
group
&
save
sample.

Check
FBC,
U&€E,
LFT,
and
clotting
daily.

Keep
nil
by
mouth
if
at
high
rebleed
risk
(see
Box
‘Management
of
peptic
ulcer
bleeds’
and
p256)—ask
the
endoscopist.

A
patient
with
an
aortic
graft
repair
and
upper
Gt
bleeding
is
considered
to
have
an
aorto-enteric
fistula
until
proven
otherwise:
ctabdomen
is
usually
required
as
well
as
endoscopy.

A
Dieulafoy
lesion
is
the
rupture

unusually
big
arteriole,
eg
in
the
fundus
of
the
stomach.
