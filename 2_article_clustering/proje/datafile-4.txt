Dysphagia
is
difficulty
in
swallowing
and
should
prompt
urgent
investigation
to
exclude
malignancy
(unless
of
short
duration,
and
associated
with
a
sore
throat).
Causes
Oral,
pharyngeal,
or
oesophageal?
Mechanical
or
motility
related?
(See
Box
‘Causes
of
dysphagia’)
Five
key
questions
to
ask
1
Was
there
difficulty
swallowing
solids
and
liquids
from
the
start?
Yes:
motility
disorder
(eg
achalasia,
CNS,
or
pharyngeal
causes).
No:
Solids
then
liquids:
suspect
a
stricture
(benign
or
malignant).
2
Isit
difficult
to
initiate
a
swallowing
movement?
Yes:
Suspect
bulbar
palsy,
especially
if
patient
coughs
on
swallowing.
3
Is
swallowing
painful
(odynophagia)?
Yes:
Suspect
ulceration
(malignancy,
oesophagitis,
viral
infection
or
Candida
in
immunocompromised,
or
poor
steroid
inhaler
technique)
or
spasm.
4
Is
the
dysphagia
intermittent
or
is
it
constant
and
getting
worse?
Intermittent:
suspect
oesophageal
spasm.
Constant
and
worsening:
suspect
malignant
stricture.
5
Does
the
neck
bulge
or
gurgle
on
drinking?
Yes:
Suspect
a
pharyngeal
pouch
(see
oxcs
p570).
Signs
Is
the
patient
cachectic
or
anaemic?
Examine
the
mouth;
feel
for
supraclavic-
ular
nodes
(left
supraclavicular
node
=
Virchow's
node—suggests
intra-abdominal
ma-
lignancy);
look
for
signs
of
systemic
disease,
eg
systemic
sclerosis
(19552),
CNS
disease.
Tests
FBC
(anaemia);
U&e
(dehydration).
Upper
GI
endoscopy
+
biopsy
(fig
6.13).
If
suspi-
cion
of
pharyngeal
pouch
consider
contrast
swallow
(ENT
opinion).
Video
fluoroscopy
may
help
identify
neurogenic
causes.
Oesophageal
manometry
for
dysmotility.
Specific
conditions
Oesophagitis:
See
p254.
Diffuse
oesophageal
spasm:
Causes
in-
termittent
dysphagia
+
chest
pain.
Contrast
swallow/manometry:
abnormal
contrac-
tions?
Achalasia:
Coordinated
peristalsis
is
lost
and
the
lower
oesophageal
sphincter
fails
to
relax
(due
to
degeneration
of
the
myenteric
plexus),
causing
dysphagia,
re-
gurgitation,
and
tweight.
Characteristic
findings
on
manometry
or
contrast
swallow
showing
dilated
tapering
oesophagus.
Treatment:
endoscopic
balloon
dilatation,
or
Heller's
cardiomyotomy—then
proton
pump
inhibitors
(PPIs,
p254).
Botulinum
toxin
in-
jection
if
a
non-invasive
procedure
is
needed
(repeat
every
few
months).
Calcium
chan-
nel
blockers
and
nitrates
may
also
relax
the
sphincter.
Benign
oesophageal
stricture:
Caused
by
gastro-oesophageal
reflux
(GRD,
p254),
corrosives,
surgery,
or
radiotherapy.
Treatment:
endoscopic
balloon
dilatation.
Oesophageal
cancer:
(p618.)
Associations:
,
GoRD,
tobacco,
alcohol,
Barrett's
oesophagus
(1695),
tylosis
(palmar
hyperkeratosis),
Plummer-Vinson
syndrome
(post-cricoid
dysphagia,
upper
oesophageal
web
+
iron-
deficiency).
cvs
causes:
Ask
for
help
from
a
speech
and
language
therapist.

ut]

Consider
pregnancy
where
appropriate!
Other
causes,
p56.

What's
in
the
vomit?
Reports
of
‘coffee
grounds’
may
indicate
upper
G1
bleeding
but
represent
one
of
the
most
over-called
signs
in
clinical
medicine
—
always
verify
yourself
and
look
for
other
evidence
of
GI
bleeding;
recognizable
food~
gastric
stasis;
feculent~small
bowel
obstruction.

Timing
Morning®pregnancy
or
ticp;
1h
post
food~gastric
stasis/gastroparesis
(DM);
vomiting
that
relieves
pain=peptic
ulcer;
preceded
by
loud
gurgling=c1
obstruction.
Tests
Bloods:
FBC,
U&E,
LFT,
Ca’,
glucose,
amylase.
AG:
A
metabolic
(hypochlor-
aemic)
alkalosis
from
loss
of
gastric
contents
(pH
>7.45,
tHCO3")
indicates
severe
vomiting.
Plain
Axr:
If
suspected
bowel
obstruction
(p728).
Upper
Gi
endoscopy:
(See
p248.)
If
suspicion
of
bleed
or
persistent
vomiting.
Consider
head
cT
in
case
tIcp.
Treatment
Identify
and
treat
underlying
causes.
Symptomatic
relief:
table
6.4.
Be
pre-emptive,
eg
pre-op
for
post-op
symptoms.
Try
oral
route
first.
30%
need
a
2nd-line
anti-emetic,
so
be
prepared
to
prescribe
more
than
one.
Give
IV
fluids
with
K*
replace-
ment
if
severely
dehydrated
or
nil-by-mouth,
and
monitor
electrolytes
and
fluid
balance.
