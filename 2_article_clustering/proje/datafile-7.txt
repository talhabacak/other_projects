EMPIRES
AND
THE
POLITICS
OF
DIFFERENCE
377

Setting
aside
this
modernist
conceit
in
favor
of
a
long-term
and
more
global
his-
ory
of
empires
forces
us
to
come
to
grips
with
the
variety
of
practiced
and
imagined
political
forms.
A
wider
perspective
helps
us
escape
from
the
conventional
assump-
ion
that
a
single
people
within
a
unitary
state
is
the
norm
from
which
other
polities
deviated
or
the
only
model
to
which
they
could
aspire.’

The
association
of
popular
sovereignty
with
a
uniform
polity
also
demands
rethinking.
The
proposition
that
sovereignty
derives
or
should
derive
from
the
people
seems
to
imply
a
radical
dichotomy
between
those
who
are
members
of
the
polity
and
those
who
are
excluded
from
it.
Such
an
argument
could
justify
subor-
dinating
colonized
people
within
a
“democratic”
empire
or
denying
political
voice
0
certain
categories
of
people
within
a
national
state.’
But
the
location
of
popular
sovereignty
was
contested
from
the
moment
the
Declaration
of
the
Rights
of
Man
and
of
the
Citizen
was
proclaimed
in
Paris
in
1789:
should
sovereignty
belong
only
o
a
French
nation
in
Europe
or
to
different
categories
of
people
in
French
colonies
in
the
Caribbean
as
well?
When
France,
for
pragmatic
as
well
as
principled
reasons,
abolished
slavery
in
Saint
Domingue
and
made
slaves
into
citizens
in
1793,
these
actions
seemed
to
signal
an
imperial
version
of
the
new
republic.
Napoleon's
res-
oration
of
slavery
in
1802
undermined
this
inclusive
strategy.
When
slavery
was
abolished
for
good
in
French
colonies
in
1848,
ex-slaves
became
citizens,
but
this
did
not
establish
a
unitary
people.
As
France
acquired
overseas
territories
during
he
nineteenth
century,
conquered
peoples
were
granted
the
lower
status
of
subjects.

Such
distinction
making
was
regularly
contested
-
by
subordinated
people
who
could
frame
their
arguments
in
terms
of
the
dominant
ideology
or
challenge
that
ideology
directly,
and
by
elites
who
took
republican
principles
or
the
threat
of
co-




onial
rebellion
seriously.?
When
an
imperial
government
needed
more
than
sub-
servience
from
much
of
its
subject
population-soldiers
in
wartime
for
instance-the
need
for
inclusive
gestures
became
stronger.!°
Questions
of
inclusion,
equality,
and
recognition
of
cultural
difference
were
thus
part
of
a
long
debate
within
the
French
empire-and
the
British
as
well-and
the
question
did
not
disappear
when
colonies
became
independent.
With
many
citizens
whose
origins
lay
in
the
former
colonies
living
in
France,
Britain,
and
other
former
imperial
powers,
prejudice
and
discrimination-and
fear
of
people
who
are
“different”-have
become
burning
is-
sues
inside
post-imperial
states.!!
Empires’
politics
of
difference
carried
over
into
fictively
national
polities.

Here
lies
the
fallacy
in
Michael
Doyle’s
(Doyle
1986,
30)
well-known
definition
of
empire
as
“effective
control,
whether
formal
or
informal,
of
a
subordinated
society
by
an
imperial
society.
He
assumes
that
societies—as
discrete
entities—have
a
prior
existence.
Societies
can
be
as
much
the
products
of
empires
as
their
component
parts.

the
sharpening
of
the
distinction
between
a
national
polity
and
subor-
dinate
colonies
within
nineteenth-century
European
empires
and
illustrates
how
often
this
distinction
was
called
into
question.
