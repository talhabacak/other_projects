Empires
and
the
Politics

Pathways
of
Incorporation

History
is
replete
with
conquest,
violence,
defeat
of
ambitious
rivals
or
vulner-
able
groups,
but
a
fundamental
question
is
what
came
next—whether
and
by
what
means
diverse
people
were
incorporated
into
a
large
polity.
As
long
as
political
am-
bition
exists
in
the
world,
and
as
long
as
human
populations
are
distinguished
by
linguistic
and
cultural
variety,
conquest
and
subjugation
will
lead
would-be
rulers
to
seek
ways
to
govern
unlike
people.

Empires
were
large
states
that
managed
to
incorporate
diverse
populations
while
reproducing
distinctions
and
hierarchy
among
them.
Over
time,
empires
developed
multiple
strategies
to
deal
with
this
essential
task,
tactics
that
we
label
the
“poli-
tics
of
difference:
In
this
chapter
we
discuss
how
empires,
compared
with
other
kinds
of
states
and
with
each
other,
confronted
difference.
We
describe
two
un-
like
approaches
to
difference,
the
“Roman”
and
“Mongol”
types.
We
then
elaborate
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
particular
governing
strategies
and
consider
the
transformations
and
repercussions
of
the
different
ways
in
which
empires
exercised
power.
Finally,
we
look
at
ways
out
of
empire,
and
how
the
politics
of
difference
inflected
these
changes
in
sovereignty.

Why
Empires,
Why
Difference?

Empires
govern
different
people
differently.
In
these
terms,
empire
could
be
a
passing
phase:
if
an
expansionist
state
erases
differences
among
the
territories
and
peoples
it
incorporates—via
some
combination
of
extermination,
accultura-
tion,
and
assimilation—it
becomes
simply
a
big
state,
distinguished
from
political
structures
in
which
distinction
is
recognized,
preserved,
or
even
cultivated.

One
might
argue
that
homogeneity
and
heterogeneity
are
both
fictive
descrip-
tions
and
that
all
polities
embody
both
tendencies
to
some
degree.
“Nation”
and
“empire”
can
be
overlapping
categories,
reflecting
tendencies
toward
heterogeneity
and
homogeneity
within
a
complex
polity.!
But
fictions
can
have
effects.
They
can
kill,
and
they
can
provide
the
basis
for
political
organization.
