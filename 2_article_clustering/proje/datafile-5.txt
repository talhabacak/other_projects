Dyspepsia
and
peptic
ulcer
disease

War
The
stomach
is
a
battle
ground
between
the
forces
of
attack
(acid,
pepsin,
Helico-
bacter
pylori,
bile
salts)
and
defence
(mucin
secretion,
cellular
mucus,
bicarbonate
secretion,
mucosal
blood
flow,
cell
turnover).
Gastric
antisecretory
agents,
eg
Hore-
ceptor
antagonists
(H2RAs),
and
proton
pump
inhibitors
(PPIs)
may
only
work
if
you
have
optimized
cytoprotection
(antacids
and
sucralfate
work
this
way).
Success
may
depend
on
you
being
not
just
a
brilliant
general,
but
also
a
tactician,
politician,
and
diplomat.
Plan
your
strategy
carefully‘
(fig
6.14).
As
in
any
war,
neglecting
psycho-
logical
factors
can
prove
disastrous.
The
aim
is
not
outright
victory
but
maintaining
the
balance
of
power
so
all
may
prosper.

Symptoms
Epigastric
pain
often
related
to
hunger,
specific
foods,
or
time
of
day,
fullness
after
meals,
heartburn
(retrosternal
pain);
tender
epigastrium.
Beware
Alarm
symptoms:
Anaemia
(iron
deficiency);
loss
of
weight;
anorexia;
recent
on-
set/progressive
symptoms;
melaena/haematemesis;
swallowing
difficulty.

H.
pylori
(See
table6.5.)
If
<55yrs
old:
‘Test
and
treat’
for
H.
pylori’
if
+ve
give
appropriate
PPI
and
2
antibiotic
combination,
eg
lansoprazole
30mg/12h
Po,
clarithromycin
250mg/12h
Po,
and
amoxicillin
1g/12h
Po
for
Iwk.
If
-ve
give
acid
suppression
alone.
»Refer
for
urgent
endoscopy
(1248)

with
dysphagia,
as
well
as
those
255
with
a/arm
symptoms
or
with
treatment-refractory
dyspepsia.
Duodenal
ulcer
(ou,
fig
6.15.)
4-fold
commoner
than
Gu.
Major
risk
factors:
H.py-
lori
(90%);
drugs
(NSAIDs;
steroids;
ssRI).
Minor:
tGastric
acid
secretion;
tgastric
emptying
(sduodenal
pH);
blood
group
0;
smoking.

Symptoms:
Asymptomatic
or
epigastric
pain
(relieved
by
antacids)
+
}weight.
Signs:
Epigastric
tenderness.
Diagnosis:
Upper
GI
endoscopy.
Test
for
H.
pylori.
Measure
gastrin
concentrations
when
off
pPis
if
Zollinger-Ellison
syndrome
(p716)
is
sus-
pected.
AA:
Non-ulcer
dyspepsia;
duodenal
Crohn's;
78;
lymphoma;
pancreatic
cancer
(p270).
Follow-up:
None;
if
good
response
to
R
(eg
PPI).

Gastric
ulcers
(Gu.)
Occur
mainly
in
the
elderly,
on
the
lesser
curve.
Ulcers
else-
where
are
more
often
malignant.
Risk
factors:
H.
pylori
(~80%);
smoking;
NSAIDs;
re-
flux
of
duodenal
contents;
delayed
gastric
emptying;
stress,
eg
neurosurgery
or
burns
(Cushing's
or
Curling's
ulcers).
Symptoms:
Asymptomatic
or
epigastric
pain
(relieved
by
antacids)
+
}weight.
Tests:
Upper
GI
endoscopy
to
exclude
malignancy
(fig
6.14);
multiple
biopsies
from
ulcer
rim
and
base
(histology,
H.
pylori).
Repeat
endoscopy
af-
ter
6-8
weeks
to
confirm
healing
and
exclude
malignancy.

Gastritis
Risk
factors:
Alcohol,
Nsalos,
H.
pylori,
reflux/hiatus
hernia,
atrophic
gastritis,
granulomas
(Crohn's;
sarcoidosis),
cmv,
Zollinger-Ellison
syndrome
&
Mé-
nétrier’s
disease
(p716
&
706).
Symptoms:
Epigastric
pain,
vomiting;
Tests:
Upper
cI
endoscopy
only
if
suspicious
features
(fig
6.14).

Treatment
Lifestyle:
4Alcohol
and
tobacco.

H.
pylori
eradication:
Triple
therapy
is
80-85%
effective
at
eradication’

Drugs
to
reduce
acid:
PPis
are
effective,
eg
lansoprazole
30mg/24h
Po
for
4
(Du)
or
8
(Gu)
wks.
Hz
blockers
have
a
place
(ranitidine
300mg
each
night
Po
for
8wks).
Drug-induced
ulcers:
Stop
drug
if
possible.
PPIs
may
be
best
for
treating
and
pre-
venting
GI
ulcers
and
bleeding
in
patients
on
NSAID
or
antiplatelet
drugs.
Misopros-
tol
is
an
alternative
with
different
se.
If
symptoms
persist,
re-endoscope,
retest
for
H.
pylori,
and
reconsider
differential
diagnoses
(eg
gallstones).
Surgery:
See
p622.
Complications
»>Bleeding
(1256),
»>perforation
(p606),
malignancy,
4gastric
outflow.
Functional
(non-ulcer)
dyspepsia
Common.
H.
pylori
eradication
(only
after
a
+ve
result)
may
help.
Some
evidence
favours
PPIs
and
psychotherapy.
Low-dose
ami-
triptyline
(10-20mg
each
night
Po)
may
help.
Antacids,
antispasmodics,
Hz
blockers,
misoprostol,
prokinetic
agents,
bismuth,
or
sucralfate
all
have
less
evidence.

H.
pylori
is
the
commonest
bacterial
pathogen
found
worldwide
(>50%
of
the
world
population
over
40yrs
has
it).
It's
a
class
I
carcinogen
causing
gastritis
(p252),
duodenal/gastric
ulcers
&
gastric
cancer/
lymphoma
(maLr,
p362),
also
associated
with
coronary
artery
disease,
Bz
and
iron
deficiency.

Lweek
of
therapy
sufficient;
2
weeks
increases
erradication
rates
by
~5%
but
also
increases

For

ant
infections

to
a
2nd-line
antibiotic
combination
(see
