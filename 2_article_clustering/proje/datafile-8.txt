Within
the
long
history
of
empires,
the
politics
of
difference
took
many
forms.
The
spectrum
of
empires
practices
runs
from
treating
difference
as
an
ordinary
fact
of
human
life
to
genocide.!?
Not
only
did
empires
come
up
with
distinctive
styles
of
rule,
but
even
a
single
empire
ordinarily
applied
an
array
of
strategies
to
different
elements
of
the
polity.
Empires
could
shift
their
tactics
over
both
time
and
space,
profiting
from
the
flexibility
of
differentiated
rule.

Imperial
rulers,
nevertheless,
were
not
free
to
choose
their
strategies
at
will.
They
acted
within
the
constraints
imposed
by
internalized
assumptions
and
habits
and
in
response
to
subjects
who
pushed
back
against
their
rulers,
even
if
such
interactions
were
rarely
symmetrical.
Empires
usually
existed
in
relation
to
and
competition
with
each
other.
Empires
could
try
to
make
nations
on
other
empires’
territories.
It
was
tempting
for
imperial
rulers
to
encourage
groups
to
secede
from
their
rivals’
composite
structures,
if
not
to
incorporate
them,
at
least
to
diminish
or
fragment
an
enemy.

If
quests
for
homogeneity
produced
and
continue
to
produce
episodes
of
ex-
treme
violence,
building
and
maintaining
empires
was
also
often
violent
and
re-
pressive.
When
entire
categories
of
people
were
treated
as
inferiors,
as
people
who
could
be
exploited,
moved
about,
or
humiliated
and
destroyed
at
will,
the
politics
of
“difference”
could
become
the
politics
of
“race.”
Francisco
Bethencourt!?
uses
the
term
“racisms”
in
the
plural
and
makes
the
point
that
each
racism
had
its
origins
in
a
political
project.
Prejudice,
stereotyping,
and
category-making
exist
in
many
kinds
of
society—from
villages
to
national
republics—but
in
specific
contexts,
elites
can
transform
distinctions
into
ideologies
of
systematic
subordination,
exploita-
tion,
or
exclusion.

What
enables
“racism”
is
the
definition
of
difference
in
terms
of
descent—often
connected
to
concerns
for
“purity
of
blood”—and
the
linkage
of
such
distinctions
to
discrimination,
oppression,
and
exploitation.!4
Descent
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
genetics.
Some
societies
or
segments
of
them
emphasize
descent
in
the
male
line
only.
An
Ottoman
sultan
was
a
pure
son
of
the
dynasty
regardless
of
the
fact
that
his
mother,
in
most
cases,
was
a
captive
from
a
non-Ottoman,
non-Muslim,
non-Turkish-speaking
region.
Someone
considered
black
in
the
antebellum
United
States
might
be
considered
mulatto
in
the
Caribbean
and
white
in
Brazil.
The
var-
iation
among
racisms
over
the
course
of
history
is
wide;
the
variation
of
politics
of
difference
even
wider.

Both
quests
for
homogeneity
and
practices
of
unequal
incorporation
can
pro-
duce
racisms.
In
empires,
there
are
countervailing
tendencies,
connected
to
the
task




of
maintaining
the
scope—and
hence
the
diversity—of
the
imperial
polity.
This
re-
liance
on
difference
gives
rise
to
arguments
among
elites.
Some,
convinced
of
